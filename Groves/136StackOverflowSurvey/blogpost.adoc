Stack Overflow releases a survey of the developer community every year. This is the 12th annual survey, and I'm very excited at link:https://stackoverflow.blog/2022/05/11/stack-overflow-2022-developer-survey-is-open/[the changes and improvements] that have gone into it.

== Who is a "Developer"?

There's often gatekeeping around who is a developer or what makes a "real developer". Stack Overflow makes it easy: a developer is someone who has written code.

So, if you've written ANY code...

* Used one of the link:https://developer.couchbase.com/[many Couchbase SDKs]? You're a developer for sure.
* A link:https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[SQL++ query]? Copy/pasted into Query Workbench? You're a developer.
* Tried out the link:https://couchbase.live/[Couchbase Playground]? You're a developer.
* Wrote some HTML for WordPress? Modified an email template? You're a developer.
* Are you in the 6th grade and you created something in link:https://scratch.mit.edu/[Scratch]? You're a developer!

== Take the Survey!

The Stack Overflow developer survey is very influential and helps everyone better understand the developer community.

You have a chance to make your voice heard!

It's not very long, maybe 10 minutes. You don't need a Stack Overflow account to participate (but since you're a developer, you should link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/couchbase[create a StackOverflow account] eventually).
