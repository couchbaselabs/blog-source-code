Look closely and you might even catch a glimpse of Couchbase's booth, and speaker Ted Neward presenting his Busy Developer's Guide to NoSQL.

## Couchbase Booth

Couchbase's booth was very busy between sessions. Everyone from students to experienced developers stopped by to discuss database and learn about Couchbase and Couchbase Capella. 

Visitors to the booth could pick up various kinds of swag, including a handy sticky note kit (which we called an "analog database"). One creative attendee used one of the sticky notes to craft a unique piece of origami

Ted Neward has recently written an article called link:https://thenewstack.io/reducing-complexity-with-a-multimodel-database/[Reducing Complexity with a Multimodel Database] for The New Stack, and he touched on some of these same points during his NoSQL session.

Not stopping there, Ted also presented another session where he surveyed next-generation languages. Those who attended left with an overview of modern language trends, problems, and solutions.

## Raspberry Pi Giveaway

One of the best moments at the Couchbase booth was the giveaway of the always hard to find Raspberry Pi 4, with a complete kit. Hundreds entered the drawing. Congratulations to the winner, Matt B!
