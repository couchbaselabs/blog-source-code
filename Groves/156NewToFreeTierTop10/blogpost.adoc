The wait for a Capella perpetual free tier is over]]]link[[[! Now the Couchbase DBaaS is available to all: students, hobbyists, startups, and enterprises alike. For those brand new to the Couchbase ecosystem, here are 10 resources you should check out that will help you get the most out of Capella.

## 1. IDE Plugins for VSCode and JetBrains

Capella has a web UI for running queries, setting up buckets, managing credentials, and more. But for day-to-day coding work, you may benefit from an IDE plugin.

* link:https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Couchbase.vscode-couchbase[VSCode]
* link:https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/22131-couchbase[JetBrains] (link:https://www.couchbase.com/blog/a-tour-couchbase-jetbrains-plugin-developers/[7 Minute Tour])

These plugins provide syntax highlighting, CRUD operations, visualizations, data migration, Couchbase Lite integration, and more.

These plugins are open source, and you can contribute to them on GitHub:

* link:https://github.com/Couchbase-Ecosystem/couchbase_jetbrains_plugin[Couchbase JetBrains plugin on GitHub]

## 2. Sample Projects

There are a variety of sample projects, in a variety of languages that range from "Hello, World" to complete applications.

### Conduit

**Conduit** (from the RealWorld project) is a spec of a basic Medium (social blog platform) clone, with implementation in a variety of frontend and backend platforms and languages. Here are some that use Couchbase:

* link:https://github.com/MacklinEngineering/Conduit[Express] (Node.js)
* link:https://github.com/couchbase-examples/realWorld-server-ottomanjs[Express + Ottoman.js] (Node.js)
* link:https://github.com/couchbase-examples/couchbase-springboot-realworld-example-app[Spring Data Couchbase + Spring Boot] (Java)
* For more on Conduit, check out this summary video from a Twitch live coding series: link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ynXWW_Vyrc[Kickstarting a Real-World ASP.NET Project with Couchbase]

### What is this thing?

**link:https://github.com/mgroves/WhatIsThisThing[What is this thing?]** Is a demo project of an ecommerce application that uses the hybrid search capabilities of Couchbase: SQL, key/value, vector, geospatial. (link:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYy0ob2GqUo[Overview video])

### RAG demos

RAG (retreival-augmented generation) is a technique that uses a large language model (LLM) to generate a response to a user query. The LLM is augmented with information from a database (usually retrieved via vector search).

* link:https://github.com/couchbase-examples/rag-demo[RAG Demo using LangChain]
* link:https://github.com/couchbase-examples/rag-demo-llama-index[RAG Demo using LlamaIndex]
* link:https://github.com/couchbase-examples/hybrid-search-demo[RAG Demo using Hybrid Search]

### Try CB

"link:https://github.com/orgs/couchbaselabs/repositories?q=try-cb[Try CB]" is a series of sample projects that demonstrate how to use Couchbase with a variety of SDKs (e.g. try-cb-ruby, try-cb-dotnet, etc)

### Hello World

If you just want to get started with a bare minimum console app, the Couchbase documentation for each SDK has a "Start Using" page that can help you through installation, connect, and execution: link:https://docs.couchbase.com/java-sdk/current/hello-world/start-using-sdk.html[Java], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/go-sdk/current/hello-world/start-using-sdk.html[Go], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/php-sdk/current/hello-world/start-using-sdk.html[PHP], and more. Click on the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/home/sdk.html[SDK of your choice] and then "Getting Started".

## 3. Framework integrations

Couchbase has a growing ecosystem of framework integrations, both official and community-contributed. Here are some of the most notable:

* link:https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-extensions/spring-data-couchbase.html[Spring Data]: for the popular Spring framework for Java

You can also ask questions, browse previous posts, and get help on the link:https://forums.couchbase.com/[Couchbase forums]. (Before posting your question, you may want to check out #10 in this blog post).

## 7. Couchbase Shell

link:https://www.nushell.sh/[Couchbase Shell] is a command-line interface that allows you to interact with Capella and/or Couchbase Server. It provides a way to execute commands and queries against Couchbase Server, as well as manage data, perform administrative tasks, and even interact with LLMs for RAG use cases.

image:15602-couchbase-shell-animated.gif[Couchbase shell]

It's built on NuShell, an open source shell that enables pipelines, treats everything as data, and has a plugin ecosystem. 

## 8. Documentation

Documentation is the treasure map that everyone ignores until they're hopelessly lost. The Couchbase documentation is a great resource for learning about Couchbase and its features.

Based on my interactions with developers over the years, here are a few pages to highlight frequently asked questions (once you get past the basics):

- link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/indexes/index-replication.html#index-consistency[Scan Consistency]: If your query isn't returning your latest documents, you probably need to review scan consistency.
- link:https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-extensions/distributed-acid-transactions.html[ACID Transactions] are available in Couchbase SQL, as well as C++, .NET, Java, Go, Node.js, PHP, and Python.
- link:https://docs.couchbase.com/scala-sdk/current/concept-docs/data-durability-acid-transactions.html[CAP Theorem]: Review the guarantees that Couchbase makes. The short answer is that Couchbase is CP (or AP over multiple data centers).
- link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/join.html[JOINs]: Yes, Couchbase supports SQL++; yes it supports JOINs.
- link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/guides/indexes.html[Indexing] is important to understand.
- Time series: Couchbase is not a time series database, but it has link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/time-series.html[time series functionality].
- CTE (Common Table Expressions): Couchbase supports link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/with.html[CTEs (`WITH ...`)] and link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/with-recursive.html[recursive CTEs (`WITH RECURSIVE ...`)]
- Subdocument: SDKs (like link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/subdocument-operations.html[.NET]) support partial reads/writes, to avoid sending large documents over the network for small changes.

Want to know more? The Couchbase documentation has an experimental AI tool that allows you to have a conversation with the documentation. Just click the Couchbase logo at the bottom right on the docs site.

image:15603-couchbase-docs-ai-chat.gif[Couchbase docs AI chat]

And finally, the docs are open source! You can submit a pull request to link:https://docs.couchbase.com/home/contribute/index.html[fix a typo or contribute a new page].

## 9. Test Containers

Automated testing is important, and when you're testing your application, you'll want to test it against a real database, not a mock. The popular Test Containers project supports Couchbase for Java, Go, .NET, and Node.js.

With Test Containers, you can create a "disposable" Couchbase container for use with integration tests in code:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
var couchbaseContainer = new CouchbaseBuilder()
  .WithImage("couchbase:enterprise-7.6.2")
  .Build();
await couchbaseContainer.StartAsync();
----

Another project that can be useful for testing is link:https://github.com/brantburnett/couchbasefakeit[CouchbaseFakeIt], a Docker image that can initialize Couchbase with indexes and fake data.

## 10. Advanced SDK tooling

When you're ready to tackle more advanced functionality and/or troubleshoot networking issues, here are some more advanced integrations for Couchbase:

* link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/sdk/sdk-doctor.html[SDK doctor] - A tool to diagnose application-server-side connectivity issues with your Couchbase or Capella Cluster. If you are having connection issues, definitely try this tool first.

* link:https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-extensions/field-level-encryption.html[Field-level encryption] - Fields within a JSON document can be securely encrypted by the SDK to support FIPS 140-2 compliance.

* link:https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-extensions/response-time-observability.html[Response time observability] - Tracing and Metrics provide fine-grained insight into how a distributed application is performing, and helps to diagnose when it is not.
