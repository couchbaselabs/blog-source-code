As a sponsor of the link:https://devnexus.com/[DevNexus] 2023 conference in Atlanta, Couchbase showcased its NoSQL database solutions to the attendees. We had a booth in the hall and a speaking session featuring Matthew Groves discussing JSON Data Modeling. Finally, the event was capped off with a prize drawing for two Raspberry Pis.

At the booth, attendees had the opportunity to learn more about Couchbase's key features, such as its familiar query language link:https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[SQL++], flexible JSON data model, and the link:https://www.couchbase.com/products/capella[Capella DBaaS]. Attendees from a variety of local companies came by the booth to discuss databases.

We brought some swag, including bags and pens, but the most popular swag had to be the Java mascot "Duke" Couchbase sticker.

The most attractive thing about the Couchbase booth, beyond the idea of link:https://www.couchbase.com/products/n1ql[SQL for JSON], was the prize giveaway: two Raspberry Pi 4 Model B's

Everyone had ideas of interesting things to build with Raspberry Pi, including link:https://www.couchbase.com/blog/arm-cpu-support-for-couchbase-server-71/[deploying Couchbase Server, which now has ARM support]. Hundreds of people entered to win. Congrats to the winners: Frank W and Ravindra T!

I was very busy during DevNexus: I presented link:https://www.couchbase.com/blog/a-json-data-modeling-guide/["JSON Data Modeling for Document Databases"] on Thursday. There were many insightful and interesting questions, and I appreciated how engaged the DevNexus audience was.
