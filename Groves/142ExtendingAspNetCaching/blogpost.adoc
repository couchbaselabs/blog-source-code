To help .NET developers better use Couchbase in their applications, there is a collection of community-supported link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions[Couchbase Extensions]. These include extensions for caching, session, multiop, compression, and locking. And there are some officially supported extensions for dependency injection, open telemetry, and transactions.

The main extension for discussion today is *Couchbase.Extensions.Caching*, which implements the link:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/performance/caching/distributed?view=aspnetcore-7.0[.NET Distributed Cache interface] using Couchbase. This can be added to your project with link:https://www.nuget.org/packages/Couchbase.Extensions.Caching[NuGet] (`dotnet add package Couchbase.Extensions.Caching`).

## Session and Caching Extensions

In recent years, the shift from Couchbase SDK 2 to SDK 3 introduced many new features and improvements, including link:https://www.couchbase.com/blog/couchbase-server-7-0-release/[scopes/collections support]. The Couchbase.Extensions family has also been updated to support SDK 3.

However, the *default* usage of this library uses the `_default` scope and `_default` collection, with no built-in option to specify anything else.

To see this in action, here's the line of configuration to add Couchbase as a distributed cache (taken from the link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/tree/master/example/Couchbase.Extensions.Caching.Example[GitHub example project]):

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
builder.Services.AddDistributedCouchbaseCache("myproject", opt => { });
----

In that code, "myproject" is a bucket name. The `opt` object doesn't have an option for scope/collection name.

Using the sample project, you'll end up with cached information like this:

image:14201-default-scope-default-collection.png[Default scope and default collection used for caching by default]

(Notice the bucket, scope, and collection names are "myproject", "_default", and "_default").

## Extending the Extension

Thankfully, the library is extensible enough that with a little bit of code, it can be pointed to whatever collection you'd like.

Let's look a little deeper at the project, specifically ICouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider.cs and DefaultCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider.cs

* `ICouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider` contains one method, `GetCollectionAsync`.
* `DefaultCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider`'s implements that method with `return bucket.DefaultCollection();`

But what if you don't want to use the default collection?

In that case, create a custom implementation of `ICouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider`. I'll call mine `CustomCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
using Couchbase.KeyValue;

namespace Couchbase.Extensions.Caching.Example.Caching;

public class CustomCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider : ICouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider
{
    private readonly ICouchbaseCacheBucketProvider _bucketProvider;
    private readonly string _scopeName;
    private readonly string _collectionName;

    public CustomCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider(ICouchbaseCacheBucketProvider bucketProvider, string scopeName, string collectionName)
    {
        _bucketProvider = bucketProvider;
        _scopeName = scopeName;
        _collectionName = collectionName;
    }

    public async ValueTask<ICouchbaseCollection> GetCollectionAsync()
    {
        var bucket = await _bucketProvider.GetBucketAsync().ConfigureAwait(false);

        var scope = await bucket.ScopeAsync(_scopeName);

        return await scope.CollectionAsync(_collectionName);
    }
}
----

Consider this a starting point. In your implementation, you can set it up however you'd like, add additional logic, etc.

The next step is to add that as a service (in Program.cs typically), specifying the scope/collection names.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
builder.Services.AddSingleton<ICouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider>(x =>
    new CustomCouchbaseCacheCollectionProvider(
        x.GetRequiredService<ICouchbaseCacheBucketProvider>(),
        "mycachingscope",
        "mycachingcollection"));
----

If you're concerned about this being overwritten by the default provider, note that link:https://github.com/couchbaselabs/Couchbase.Extensions/blob/master/src/Couchbase.Extensions.Caching/CouchbaseCacheServiceCollectionExtensions.cs#L30[`TryAddSingleton` is used inside of `AddDistributedCouchbaseCache`]. This means that it *won't* override your custom provider with the default provider.

## Custom Provider in Action

This extension will not actually create the specified scope and collection, so make sure you've created them ahead of time.

Run the app, and try out the Weather Forecast API with the OpenAPI interactive page. The first time executing the endpoint will result in a "cache miss", at which point the weather forecast data will be written to the collection specified:

image:14202-custom-scope-custom-collection.png[Swagger OpenAPI example]

(Notice the bucket, scope, and collection names are "myproject", "mycachingscope", and "mycachingcollection").

## Summary

With a custom implementation of an interface, and one extra line in `Program.cs`, you can specify whatever scope/collection you want to store cached data into.

Further, the *Couchbase.Extensions.Session* extension uses the caching extension as the underlying storage mechanism.

Happy caching!
