<p>One great benefit of open-source projects lies in their ability to encourage a diverse and collaborative learning environment. They allow developers from different backgrounds to compare and contrast methodologies, and most importantly, learn from each other. One such open-source initiative, which is changing the way we view demo apps, is the <a href="https://codebase.show/projects/realworld">RealWorld project</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_introducing_the_realworld_project">Introducing the RealWorld Project</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The RealWorld project is an open-source specification for a <a href="https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/intro">medium.com clone called 'Conduit.'</a> It allows any developer to create both backend and frontend implementations of the spec. Through this platform, you can see how the exact same application is constructed using different languages, frameworks, and databases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While demo apps play a crucial role in understanding the functionalities of frameworks and databases, their  implementations often lack practicality. These applications are scattered all over, making it challenging to locate and compare. The RealWorld project aims to improve the landscape and make it easier for developers to get started.</p>

<h2 id="_what_is_conduit">What is Conduit?</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project has developed a specification for both frontend and backend applications. This specification creates a clone of Medium.com, a social blogging site, known as 'Conduit'.</p>

<p><span class="image"><img src="http://blog.couchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/14903-Conduit-spec-example.png" alt="Example of the Conduit spec"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Contributors can implement frontends or backends in the languages, frameworks, and databases of their choice. Since they all adhere to the same specification, frontends and backends can be interchanged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At present, there are approximately 100 backend examples available on the site, employing 20 languages and a multitude of frameworks.</p>

<h2 id="_my_contribution_building_with_asp_net_couchbase">My Contribution: Building with ASP.NET + Couchbase</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inspired by this initiative, I embarked on a journey to build an <a href="https://github.com/mgroves/realworld-aspnet-couchbase">ASP.NET + Couchbase implementation</a>. Upon completion, this project will be submitted to the RealWorld index site, offering .NET developers a solid starting point for creating their own applications with Couchbase.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project will include a suite of automated tests, ensuring that the project remains maintainable and up-to-date. Another unique feature is its construction: it is being built live and in public, on <a href="https://twitch.tv/matthewdgroves">Twitch.tv</a>.</p>

<h2 id="_live_building_on_twitch_tv">Live Building on Twitch.tv</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why Twitch? It&#8217;s a home to a sizable <a href="https://livecoders.dev/">"live coding" community</a>. The live coding sessions allow others to join in, watch, chat, contribute, and even collaborate. However, I am considering branching out to other live video platforms such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CouchbaseServer">YouTube</a> and LinkedIn shortly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an added bonus, I am using LLM tools like <a href="https://openai.com/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> and <a href="https://github.com/features/preview/copilot-x">GitHub Copilot Chat</a> to experiment with ways to build this project faster. I aim to help developers understand the pros and cons of these tools along the way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the live streams are recorded and subsequently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZWwU1YVRehL0psJRk35x8evMeeGAFwBa">posted on YouTube</a>, thus creating a rich repository of resources for developers worldwide. Shorter, summary videos are also being created. You can check out the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcspbWiU9RuvvdK38xbstocZ2rLRPBibe">playlist of summary videos</a> or browse a collection of video links in the <a href="https://github.com/mgroves/realworld-aspnet-couchbase">GitHub README</a>.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This project aims to establish a blueprint for future contributions using other languages and frameworks. We can commence with the Conduit spec and add all Couchbase-specific details and architectural choices. For instance, for those new to Couchbase, it&#8217;s not always clear <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/blog/a-json-data-modeling-guide/">how to model data</a> (embed? refer?) and which data operations to use (<a href="https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/guides/kv-operations.html">key-value</a>? <a href="https://www.couchbase.com/sqlplusplus/">SQL++</a>?)</p>
