:title: ASP.NET Core CRUD with NoSQL Guide
:livesqllink: https://couchbase.live/examples/basic-sql++-basics

= Build an ASP.NET Core CRUD with NoSQL application

CRUD is a familiar concept to developers, and it's a great first step at getting to know how to work with a database.

CRUD is:

* Create (inserting new data)
* Read (retrieving or querying data)
* Update (changing existing data)
* Delete (removing data)

This guide will show you how to get up and running with ASP.NET Core and NoSQL (Couchbase) to create a very simple CRUD HTTP API. This API will be operating on a gift wishlist: all the items you want for your birthday. This guide won't cover building an HTML UI, but you could use this API with the client-side framework of your choice (like React or Blazor, etc).

== Developer tools you'll need

This guide uses Visual Studio 2022 (Enterprise), but you should be able to follow along with JetBrains Rider, VSCode, or whatever you normally use. If you are having trouble getting started, you can post questions in link:https://forums.couchbase.com/c/net-sdk/6[Couchbase .NET SDK forums] or in the link:https://blog.couchbase.com/couchbase-on-discord/[Couchbase Discord].

This guide uses link:https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up[Couchbase Capella], which is Couchbase's DBaaS (DataBase as a Service) offering. You can sign up for a free trial: https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up

The *travel-sample* bucket is already loaded when you deploy your trial cluster. For this guide, create link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/data-service/manage-buckets.html[another bucket ] called "demo".

image:13501-capella-buckets.png[Capella list of buckets]

Inside that bucket, there's a _default scope. Inside that scope, create a "wishlist" collection. (link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/data-service/scopes-collections.html[Learn more about scopes and collections in Capella])

image:13502-wishlist-collection.png[Capella list of collections]

== CRUD credentials

You'll also need to link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/manage-database-users.html[create database credentials] with read/write access to everything in the 'demo' bucket.

image:13503-create-credentials.png[Capella add database credentials]

Finally, link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/allow-ip-address.html[whitelist the IP address] that you will be compiling and running your app from, so you can connect.

image:13504-whitelist-ip-capella.png[Capella IP address whitelist]

== Start an ASP.NET Core app

In Visual Studio, select File->New ->Project->ASP.NET Core Web API. Call it something like *AspNetCoreTutorial*.

image:13506-visual-studio-new-web-api.png[Visual Studio new project]

Currently .NET 6 should be the default, and all the other defaults are fine
(notice that OpenAPI, aka Swagger, is enabled).

image:13507-visual-studio-web-api-information.png[Visual Studio new project additional information]

This process creates a basic shell ASP.NET Core site.

Next, use NuGet to add the Couchbase .NET SDK (CouchbaseNetClient).

image:13508-nuget-couchbase.png[NuGet Couchbase]

=== Notes on the .NET SDK

The Couchbase .NET SDK enables connection to a Couchbase cluster. Couchbase is a distributed database, so typically there are several servers (called "nodes") in a group (called a "cluster") that all act together. A cluster has one or more "buckets", which as you saw earlier, contains scopes, which
contain collections, which contain documents.

The data in a bucket is distributed among the nodes in the cluster, but it's treated as a single logical entity by the SDK.

Within a collection, each link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/data-service/manage-documents.html[document] has a unique "key" and a JSON "value".

For the trial version of Capella, there will only be a single node. However, this doesn't affect your code: when nodes are added, the SDK is smart enough to be able to find them on its own.

link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/sizing.html[In production, you will typically have at least three nodes], possibly a few buckets, and as many scopes
and collections as you need (within reason).

== Dependency Injection

Let's also add the Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection NuGet package (Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection). This will provide extension methods to easily add Couchbase capabilities to ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection.

(This package makes it easier to use Couchbase with ASP.NET Core. It is optional, but highly recommended).

== Connect ASP.NET Core to Couchbase Capella

The ASP.NET app first needs to connect to the Capella cluster.

In Program.cs, use the extension method on services:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Program.cs[tag=addservice]
----

(In this example, the connection information is hardcoded, but you can also use the configuration in appsettings.json instead).
			
One more step: when the application stops, it needs to release any Couchbase resources that .NET is using.

You can register code to execute on lifetime events, such as ApplicationStopped.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Program.cs[tag=cleanup]
----

Now, ASP.NET Core's dependency injection system will automatically inject Couchbase objects when you need them.

== Data Modeling

Before writing more code, let's think about the data model. It's going to be a very simple model: just the name of an item for the wishlist.

In a NoSQL document database, each piece of data has a key and a JSON value. The key can just be a GUID (you could also make it a more meaningful key if you need to). Each item on the wishlist has a "name", so there's going to be a name field. That's all there is to this model (so far).

Create a C# class to represent an item:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Models/WishlistItem.cs[tag=wishlistitem]
----

A really simple model, but because Couchbase does not require a pre-defined schema, adding more fields can be as easy as adding them right here in the C# class.

Next, "prime" the database with a couple of Wishlist items.

Navigate to the wishlist collection in Couchbase Capella and add two documents.

The first document will have a key "3ca6e87e-c3a6-4637-989d-33cbca5002b5". Give it a name of something you want, like "Skyline Chili T-Shirt". The second document will have a key "31c9cc33-8dfe-440c-bd1b-bb038939d2e0", and has a name of "Joey Votto Jersey".

image:13509-json-documents-capella.png[JSON documents in Capella]

You can add other documents if you'd like, but eventually the ASP.NET Core app will be creating the documents.

== Controller for NoSQL CRUD actions

Next, create an ASP.NET Controller for all of the CRUD operations. Call it "GiftsController".

In the constructor, specify an `IBucketProvider` parameter. This is an object that can be used to get a Bucket object from the Couchbase DependencyInjection module.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=controllerstart]

    // ...
}
----

Execute the app, just to verify that the connection works. There won't be any endpoints yet (except the WeatherForecast example that Microsoft put in as an example).

== SQL{plus}{plus} to read

Let's build an endpoint that will read data from Couchbase using SQL.

Couchbase is unique among NoSQL databases in that it supports a {livesqllink}[full SQL implementation] (called SQL{plus}{plus}, n√©e N1QL) to query JSON data.

SQL{plus}{plus} is not a watered-down "SQL-like" language. With SQL{plus}{plus}, you have link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/join.html[JOINs], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/with.html[CTEs/WITH], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/update.html[UPDATE], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/insert.html[INSERT], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/delete.html[DELETE], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/merge.html[MERGE], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/groupby.html[aggregation/GROUP BY], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/begin-transaction.html[BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK], and more.

On top of that (the "{plus}{plus}"), you also get features to deal with JSON data, like link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/datatypes.html#datatype-missing[MISSING], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/nest.html[NEST], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/arrayfun.html[ARRAY_* functions], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/objectfun.html[OBJECT_* functions], and more.

For this simple CRUD application, only a simple SQL{plus}{plus} `SELECT` query (and index) to return *all* items from the wishlist will be used (for now).

== Writing your first SQL{plus}{plus} query

First, try writing a SQL{plus}{plus} query to get all wishlist items right in the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/query-service/query-workbench.html[Capella Query Workbench].

To start with, try:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT * FROM demo._default.wishlist;
----

When you do this, you should get an error message. Something like:

----
`no index available on keyspace default:demo._default.wishlist that matches your query. Use CREATE PRIMARY INDEX` ...
----

This is expected behavior. (Most) SQL{plus}{plus} queries in Couchbase will not run unless there is at least one index available for them. Couchbase does _not_ enable you to do a full scan of all documents by default (because it can lead to serious performance issues in production).

Create a simple link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/createprimaryindex.html[`PRIMARY INDEX`] with a command like this:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX `ix_wishlist` ON `demo`.`_default`.`wishlist`
----

Primary indexes are generally not meant to be used in a typical production environment, but they are very helpful for a development environment, since they guarantee that *any* SQL{plus}{plus} query will run on the indexed collection (though not as efficient as a properly indexed collection). Once you start creating more complex SQL{plus}{plus} queries, you can use the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/query-service/query-workbench.html#index-advisor["Advise" button on the Query Workbench] to get suggestions of more efficient indexes to create

NOTE: Just as in the relational world, good indexes are important, and so is avoiding `SELECT *` whenever you can).

After creating the index, retry the above `SELECT` query again, and the results should look like this:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
[
  {
    "wishlist": {
      "name": "Skyline Chili T-Shirt"
    }
  },
  {
    "wishlist": {
      "name": "Joey Votto jersey"
    }
  }
]
----

Try imagining this array of objects being serialized to a C# `List<WishlistItem>`. It wouldn't quite work, because the objects are nested with the collection name. So, it can be helpful to get into a habit of aliasing the collections:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT w.* FROM demo._default.wishlist w;
----

NOTE: Using aliases will help you later when writing more complex SQL queries that use JOINs.

Which produces the result:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
[
  {
    "name": "Skyline Chili T-Shirt"
  },
  {
    "name": "Joey Votto jersey"
  }
]
----

There's still something missing from this result. Where are those GUIDs used for the document keys? Couchbase doesn't store them as data; it stores them as *metadata*. SQL{plus}{plus} provides the `META()` function to query metadata. Use `META().id` like this:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT META(w).id, w.* FROM demo._default.wishlist w;
----

And that produces a result of:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
[
  {
    "id": "2dab198b-1836-4409-9bdf-17275a2b2462",
    "name": "Skyline Chili T-Shirt"
  },
  {
    "id": "31c9cc33-8dfe-440c-bd1b-bb038939d2e0",
    "name": "Joey Votto jersey"
  }
]
----

This will serialize nicely into `WishlistItem` objects, using the class created earlier.

== Using SQL{plus}{plus} in ASP.NET Core

Next, put that SQL{plus}{plus} query into an ASP.NET Core endpoint.

In GiftsController, create a endpoint called GetAll:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("api/getall")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetAll()
    {

    }
----

To execute SQL{plus}{plus}, you need an object of type `Cluster`. SQL{plus}{plus} runs at the cluster level (not bucket, or scope, or collection, since it may need to `JOIN`/`UNION` between them). You could add link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/managing-connections.html#injecting-the-couchbase-cluster[`ClusterProvider`] as a constructor parameter. If this endpoint was going to _only_ work with SQL{plus}{plus}, that would be a good idea. However, let's stick with `BucketProvider` for now. There is an object of type `BucketProvider`. From that object, you can get a object of type `Cluster`:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
    [HttpGet]
    [Route("api/getall")]
    public async Task<IActionResult> GetAll()
    {
        var bucket = await _bucketProvider.GetBucketAsync("demo");
        var cluster = bucket.Cluster;

        // ... snip ...
    }
----

A `cluster` object is how ASP.NET Core will interact with a Couchbase cluster in a variety of ways. For now, let's look at its `QueryAsync<T>` method:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
[HttpGet]
[Route("api/getall")]
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAll()
{
    var bucket = await _bucketProvider.GetBucketAsync("demo");
    var cluster = bucket.Cluster;

    var result = await cluster.QueryAsync<WishlistItem>(
        "SELECT META(w).id, w.* FROM demo._default.wishlist w"
    );

    return Ok(result);
}
----

Make sure you have the following `using` statements at the top of your GiftsController.cs file:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
using AspNetCoreTutorial.Models;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Couchbase;
using Couchbase.KeyValue;
using Couchbase.Query;
using Couchbase.Extensions.DependencyInjection;
----

NOTE: When executing SQL{plus}{plus}, there are a number of link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/n1ql-queries-with-sdk.html#scan-consistency[(scan) consistency options]. The default is `ScanConsistency.NotBounded`. This setting means that the query engine will *not* wait on indexes to finish updating before returning results. This is the most performant option. However, in some situations, you will want stronger index consistency. Couchbase provides `RequestPlus` and `AtPlus`.

== Try out the ASP.NET Core Endpoint

From Visual Studio, Ctrl+F5 will start the app. You should see an OpenAPI / Swagger page in your browser.

image:13510-open-api-asp-net-screenshot.png[OpenAPI / Swagger]

(Ignore WeatherForecast, that just came with the Visual Studio template).

Click on the endpoint to try it out. There are no parameters to specify, so just click "Execute".

image:13511-open-api-asp-net-result.png[OpenAPI / Swagger]

You now have the "R" of CRUD in place.

== Key-value vs SQL?

Couchbase's SQL++ is a powerful query language, containing all the best features of relational SQL, with a superset of features for querying JSON data.

However, SQL++ isn't the only way to interact with data in Couchbase. In this post, we'll explore using the key-value API.

If you have a relational background, then you are likely accustomed to SQL being _the only_ way to interact with data (even if you're using a tool like Entity Framework Core, it's still ultimately using SQL). One of the great features of a NoSQL database (like Couchbase) is that while SQL is available, there are other access methods available too. (Hence the link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backronym[backronym] "Not Only SQL").

For Couchbase, the most efficient way to access data is via link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/guides/kv-operations.html[key-value lookup]. Every other index and query that Couchbase supports (link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/n1ql/n1ql-intro/queriesandresults.html[SQL++], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/fts/fts-introduction.html[Full Text Search], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/analytics/introduction.html[Analytics], link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/eventing/eventing-overview.html[Eventing], and more) are ultimately built upon or rely up the lowly key-value lookup.

In a situation where:

* A key is specified, or
* Your code is given a key, or
* You can construct a key deterministically

the key-value API will give you the best performance.

== Examples: when to use key-value

Here are some examples of when (and when NOT) to use the key-value API for reading:

|===
| Use case | Key-value? | Why or why not?

| Lookup a user with key "73892" | Yes | Direct look up
| Lookup just the email address of a user with key "73892" | Yes | Even if the user document is large, Couchbase has a key-based link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/guides/reading-data.html#reading-a-sub-document[sub-document API], which allows you to retrieve a portion of the document.
| Lookup a group of users with keys "73892", "47212", and "90491" | Yes | This may require multiple key lookup operations, but this still may be faster than using a SQL `SELECT ... WHERE ... IN` query.
| Lookup the comments from a blog post | Maybe | If comments for a blog post are in a single document, and the blog post key is known, a blog post comment key can be constructed. E.g. blog post key is `I-like-balloons`, to get comments, use the key `I-like-balloons::comments`
| Lookup all users from "Ohio" | No | User's state is likely a "secondary" attribute, not a key (multiple users can be from Ohio). This is a good use case for SQL++
| Search for products with "balloons" in their description | No | Descriptions are a secondary attribute, not a key (multiple products may have "balloons" in their description). This is a good use case for Full Text Search (FTS)
|===

Note that Couchbase has a memory-first architecture. The built-in cache means that a key-value look up will often be retrieving data directly from memory--microsecond latency, no waiting on the disk.

A good rule of thumb is: use key-value API whenever possible, and then fall back to a more flexible option like SQL++ or Full Text Search when necessary.

== Create a Get CRUD endpoint

Let's create an endpoint that uses the key-value API to retrieve a single item from the wishlist.

This endpoint will require the ID of the wishlist item to be given as a parameter:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=get]
----

In this example, you don't need a `cluster` object (like you did with SQL++), but you do need a link:https://blog.couchbase.com/scopes-and-collections-for-modern-multi-tenant-applications-couchbase-7-0/[collection] object. Note that since the wishlist collection is in the "_default" scope, you can link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/concept-docs/collections.html#using-collections-scopes[skip right past getting the scope and go directly from bucket to collection].

When the item is returned from `GetAsync`, it's in an `IGetResult` object. Couchbase doesn't store C# objects, it stores JSON. So, to serialize to a `WishlistItem` object, use `item.ContentAs<WishlistItem>`.

NOTE: This API gives you flexibility: a document returned from Couchbase could be serialized to `WishlistItem` in one place and `AmazonWishlistItem` in another part of the application.

== Key-value in action

Execute the ASP.NET Core application and look at the updated OpenAPI / Swagger page.

image:13512-open-api-get-endpoint.png[Get endpoint in Swagger]

The endpoint `/api/get/{id}` under "Gifts" should now be listed. Expand that endpoint by clicking on it. Unlike the `/api/getall` endpoint, this one requires a parameter: the ID of the wishlist item that you want to get. If you don't remember one of the GUIDs, you can execute `/api/getall` first and copy one of them, or use: "31c9cc33-8dfe-440c-bd1b-bb038939d2e0" (which was the ID for the Joey Votto jersey). Click "Try it out", paste that id, and click "Execute":

image:13513-get-endpoint-response.png[Get endpoint in Swagger]

Notice that in the response, the ID returned is `null`. This is because, as explained earlier, Couchbase stores the ID as metadata. In this situation, that's not a big deal. The ID was given as a parameter, so you could just assign that to C# object being returned:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
var itemObj = item.ContentAs<WishlistItem>();
itemObj.Id = Guid.Parse(id);

return Ok(itemObj);
----

NOTE: If you don't want to return `id` at all, you could create a separate C# view class that only has `name`, and use that with `ContentAs`.

== What about validation and error handling?

This endpoint is definitely not ready for production. What's missing?

* Error handling: what if there's an exception?
* Validation: what if the ID passed in is invalid?
* Authentication/authorization: what if the consumer of this API isn't supposed to have read access?
* Logging: what if something doesn't go quite right, and you want to examine the outcome later?

These are all important concerns. For most of these, ASP.NET Core has built-in functionality and/or popular 3rd party libraries available to help you. But make sure to check out Couchbase documentation on link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/error-handling.html[Handling Errors with the .NET SDK] and link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/manage/manage-security/security-management-overview.html[Security Management Overview].

== Create and Update

Until this point, the only data modifications we've made have been directly in the Couchbase Capella UI (creating two wishlist items manually). In this post, let's add an endpoint to handle creating and updating wishlist data.

== SQL++ vs Key-Value: Revisited

SQL{plus}{plus} includes `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE` syntax. So, you could use SQL{plus}{plus} to build an endpoint for mutating data. It would be very similar to the code written early to run a `SELECT` query.

A keyword in SQL{plus}{plus} that you might not have seen before is `UPSERT`. As you might guess, it's a combination of `UPDATE` and `INSERT`. An update will happen if the data already exists; an insert will happen if it doesn't. Here's how an upsert endpoint using SQL{plus}{plus} might look:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=editWithSql]
----

Two important things to point out about this code:

* It handles both create and update. If `item` has a null id, this code assumes that a new wishlist item is being created.

* Parameterization: just as in relational databases, SQL{plus}{plus} can be vulnerable to link:https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection[SQL injection], so parameterization is highly recommended. Notice that SQL{plus}{plus} syntax uses `$` to indicate named paramters (e.g. `$id` and `$name`).

This endpoint will work. But as was the case earlier, you do not always have to use SQL{plus}{plus} to interact with Couchbase. In fact, very similar criteria apply to making the decision when to use key-value and when to use SQL{plus}{plus}:

|===
| Use case | Key-value? | Why or why not?

| Create a new user with key "73892" | Yes | Direct access
| Modify a user with key "73892" | Yes | Direct access
| Modify just the email address of a user with key "73892" | Yes | Even if the user document is large, Couchbase has a key-based link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/guides/updating-data.html#updating-a-sub-document[sub-document API], which allows you to modify a portion of the document.
| Modify a group of users with keys "73892", "47212", and "90491" | Yes | This may require multiple key-value operations, but this still may be faster than using a SQL `SELECT ... WHERE ... IN` query.
| Modify all addresses to use "OH" instead of "Ohio" | No | User's state is likely a "secondary" attribute, not a key (multiple users can be from Ohio). This is a good use case for a SQL++ `UPDATE`
|===

Because this endpoint only needs to add or change one single wishlist item, use the key-value API instead.

== Write a CreateOrEdit CRUD endpoint

Before coding, it's wise to think about whether CreateOrEdit should be a single endpoint, or split into a Create endpoint and an Edit endpoint. For this very simple wishlist app, there is no validation, authentication, or other system-wide cross cutting concerns. However, in a production system, "adding" data and "updating" data may very well follow different business rules and require different permissions. In that case, you may want to break the operations into two endpoints.

For now, let's start with a single endpoint that uses an "upsert":

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=edit]
----

Much like the SQL++ endpoint, this endpoint looks at `Id` to determine whether this is a "create" or an "update".

The `UpsertAsync` function will either:

* Create a new document with `id.ToString()` as the key
* Change an existing document with a key of `id.ToString()`

In either case, once this endpoint finishes executing, you will end up with a JSON document like `{ "name" = "wishlist item name"}` and a GUID as a key (technically all keys in Couchbase are strings).

NOTE: One subtle difference between the two APIs, is that the `UPSERT` SQL++ statement will only mutate the one field (`name`), while the key-value method `UpsertAsync` will mutate the entire document (which is only `name` for now). Keep reading for more about using the sub-document key-value API.

== ASP.NET Core C and U in action

Fire up your application from Visual Studio with CTRL+F5, and you should see some new endpoints show up in the OpenAPI / Swagger UI:

image:13514-swagger-create-update-endpoints.png[Edit endpoints in Swagger]

From an API consumer's perspective, both `/api/edit` and `/api/editWithSql` endpoints will function the same. Try it once leaving the ID blank to create a new item, then try it again with a known ID (use `/api/getall` if you need to get an ID) and observe what happens and what changes.

For instance, adding a new item "Digital Photo Frame", by leaving the ID blank (let's say a GUID of  "1c3de2e7-70ea-4ee2-803b-425bbf6251cb" was provided by `Guid.NewGuid()`), and in a seperate request, the item with ID of "2dab198b-1836-4409-9bdf-17275a2b2462" was updated to have a name of "Skyline Chili 2XL T-Shirt". Here are the results as seen in the Couchbase Capella UI:

image:13515-couchbase-capella-wishlist-edit.png[Couchbase Capella UI after creating and updating]

== Deleting with SQL{plus}{plus} or Key-Value

Hopefully you're noticing a pattern. Just as with reading, creating, and updating, you've got multiple paths for deleting. You can use a SQL{plus}{plus} `DELETE` statement:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
DELETE FROM demo._default.wishlist w
WHERE META(w).id = "1c3de2e7-70ea-4ee2-803b-425bbf6251cb"
----

Or you can use a key-value delete operation (aka "Remove"):

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
await collection.RemoveAsync("1c3de2e7-70ea-4ee2-803b-425bbf6251cb");
----

And as before, here are the very similar guidelines to help you decide which one to use:

|===
| Use case | Key-value? | Why or why not?

| Delete a user with key "73892" | Yes | Direct access
| Delete a group of users with keys "73892", "47212", and "90491" | Yes | This may require multiple key-value operations, but this still may be faster than using a SQL `DELETE ... WHERE ... IN` query.
| Delete every user from "Ohio" | No | User's state is likely a "secondary" attribute, not a key (multiple users can be from Ohio). This is a good use case for a SQL++ `DELETE`

== A Delete endpoint for ASP.NET Core

With that in mind, create a delete endpoint like so:

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=delete]
----

Try this endpoint with OpenAPI / Swagger, and it will behave how you'd expect.

== Should I really delete?

In many use cases, you may not want to *actually* delete data. You may want to do something called a "soft" delete. This involves moving or marking the data in such a way that it still exists in the database, but it is no longer shown to the end user. This has the benefit of being discoverable, recoverable, and reportable.

It's also a great opportunity to show the flexibility of a JSON NoSQL database.

== Soft-deleting

Let's introduce a "deleted" field to wishlist items. This field will contain a date/time that the item was deleted. If this field exists, the rest of the endpoint should consider this item to be deleted. However, if necessary, you can still query it, report on it, and recover it.

In a relational database, this would likely require an `ALTER` to add a new column. Depending on the size of your data, it could require some downtime, or possibly a lot of NULL values. In a JSON database, there is no need to tell the database anything about a new field.

Let's use the link:https://docs.couchbase.com/dotnet-sdk/current/howtos/subdocument-operations.html[subdocument API] to add a "deleted" field to the document. Subdocument means that you will only operate on a *portion* of the JSON, and leave the rest alone.

[source,C#,indent=0]
----
include::src/AspNetCoreTutorial/AspNetCoreTutorial/Controllers/GiftsController.cs[tag=softDelete]
----

This code sends a command to Couchbase: `for the document with such-and-such ID, upsert a field called "deleted" and give it the current date/time as a value`.

Notice that with sub-document, you didn't have to first load the existing document, and you didn't have to send the _entire_ modified document back over the wire. Using the sub-document API can reduce network traffic and improve performance.

== Soft-deleted data

The end result will be a document that looks like this:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
  "name": "Digital Photo Frame",
  "deleted": "2022-04-21T11:05:26.1766248-04:00"
}
----

The other documents in the wishlist do *not* have a `deleted` field. They still look like:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
  "name": "Skyline Chili 2XL T-Shirt"
}
----

and

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
{
  "name": "Joey Votto jersey"
}
----

Note that they don't have a `"deleted": null` field; they don't have a `"deleted"` field at all.

== Soft-deleted SELECT

The data is *marked* as deleted, but it's still in the database. Next, you need to modify the `GetAll` endpoint (link:https://blog.couchbase.com/asp-net-core-crud-with-nosql-part-2/[see part 2 for more about `GetAll`]) to take this into account:

[source,SQL,indent=0]
----
SELECT META(w).id, w.*
FROM demo._default.wishlist w
WHERE w.deleted IS MISSING
----

I've introduced some more SQL{plus}{plus} syntax here: `MISSING`. This is a concept that doesn't exist in relational databases. In relational, any column specified in the query must be defined and must have a value (even if it's null). With a JSON NoSQL document database, there is no such constraint.

== Improving the index

One last point to discuss is indexing. Early on in this guide, a primary index was created just to get started. However, that index will rarely be the most efficient. link:https://docs.couchbase.com/server/current/learn/services-and-indexes/indexes/global-secondary-indexes.html[Creating and tuning indexes] is a deep topic, just as it is in the relational database world.

Fortunately, Couchbase Capella has a built-in link:https://docs.couchbase.com/cloud/clusters/query-service/query-workbench.html#index-advisor["Advise" tool] that can recommend better indexes. Just click "Advise" in the Query Workbench (or you can use `ADVISE` syntax).

image:13516-index-advisor.png[Index Advisor]

In this case, it gives the following recommendation:

[source,JavaScript,indent=0]
----
"recommended_indexes": {
          "indexes": [
            {
              "index_statement": "CREATE INDEX adv_deletedISMISSING ON `default`:`demo`.`_default`.`wishlist`(`deleted` IS MISSING) WHERE `deleted` IS MISSING",
              "index_statement_relative": "CREATE INDEX adv_deletedISMISSING ON `wishlist`(`deleted` IS MISSING) WHERE `deleted` IS MISSING",
              "keyspace_alias": "wishlist_w",
              "query_context": "default:demo._default",
              "recommending_rule": "Index keys follow order of predicate types: 2. equality/null/missing."
            }
          ]
        }
----

In the case of this very small amount of wishlist data, this index is probably not worth creating. However, if you go on to manage the wishlists of an entire eCommerce site, this index would be a good starting point.

== The end of CRUD

You now have a very simple ASP.NET Core CRUD application with Couchbase. The final API surface looks like:
